# Hi, I'm Jake! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an experienced software engineer with a B.S. in Computer Science and some handy devops and leadership skills. I've enjoyed writing and teaching software since 2014, and I focus on communication, teamwork, and pragmatism. I heard once that "you should write code like the next maintainer knows where you live", and that one just really stuck with me.

If you're here for the [Discord Battlebot](https://github.com/jakethedev/beatbattlebot), you've come to the right place!
