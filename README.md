## Hi, I'm Jake! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an experienced software engineer with a B.S. in Computer Science and some handy devops and leadership skills. I've enjoyed writing and teaching software since 2014, and I focus on communication, teamwork, and pragmatism. I heard once that "you should write code like the next maintainer knows where you live", and that one just really stuck with me.

I'm currently employed writing features and fixes for a legacy finance software stack, but I make time to design and build my own projects for the sake of learning and staying well-rounded. My pride and joy is [battlebot](https://github.com/jakethedev/beatbattlebot), a DiscordJS bot that facilitates music competitions with deadlines, voting, and other neat stuff - new features are prioritized by upcoming Discord events, check out the [issue milestones](https://github.com/jakethedev/beatbattlebot/milestones) for more information. This bot is currently live in multiple servers, including one community of ~3000 people running multiple beat battles per month. I'm also the sole SRE of battlebot, and I'm proud of its uptime ðŸ˜„

<!--If you like the work I'm doing and want to support it, feel free to make a PR for an open issue in the battlebot repo, or if you're feeling generous you can always throw a few bucks in my [guitar case](https://jakebelowmusic.com/tip-jar)-->

## Selection of Interesting Projects I've Worked On

### [Beatbattlebot](https://github.com/jakethedev/beatbattlebot) (open source, active development âœ¨)
- Voting: parsing and counting a ballot of votes from a single discord message was a tricky problem to solve, especially from a UX perspective
- Podium tie-breaking: currently implementing a way to change the tie-break algorithm per server, allowing choices such as "earliest submission" or "random"
- Auto-deployment: using systemd and cron to automate the deploy in a highly secure fashion
- Project management: organizing and prioritizing tasks has become a critical skill as I've progressed my vision for what this bot can be
- User experience: CLI UX for users that have never used a CLI is a continuous challenge
- Semi-custom test suite: I'm using Jest as the core framework, but DiscordJS doesn't seem to have any mock objects, so I'm building out generators for common types such as users and messages

### Version Management and Deploy Tooling (previous employment)
- General maintenance: from features to failures, the standard dev experience
- Improved workflows: provided an easier way to create new projects while making the code path easier to maintain
- Python support: integrated the Python CI/CD work listed below, includes building out the deploy process

### Python 2 and 3 CI/CD Pipeline (previous employment)
- Libraries and templates: developed central logging and system property access libraries; built project templates for CLI and Flask applications
- Leading design decisions: regularly conferred with experts and users of the system to make decisions that fit the problem best, not just my internal version of the problem
- Testability: using Docker made this fairly straightforward, but was a significant learning process of its own

### [Minesweeper Clone](https://github.com/jakethedev/minesweeper-java) (side project from long ago)
- Auto-clearing open spaces: I made a point to figure this out without help, and I'm sure the algorithm could be more efficient, but it seems to work fast enough
